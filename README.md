## The virtual Cell
Developing a visual environment for designing and simulating virtual cells.

- Substrate, s.
- Metabolism converting substrate s into product p.
- Substrate and product transporter.
- DNA synthesis.
- Protein synthesis and degratation.
- Lipid synthesis.

The lipid membrane separates the inside of the cell from the outside environment, 
allowing for unequal substrate and product concentrations inside and outside the 
cell (s#in, p#in and s#ext, p#ext respectively). Each of the components is 
associated with a cellular process (e.g. molecule synthesis or substrate conversion), 
which is modeled by one or more diﬀerential equations. The proposed model describes
an av- erage cell in a growing population of cells. Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations (ODEs) 
in this model describe the change of molecule concentrations in time.
