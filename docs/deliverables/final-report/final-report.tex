	\section{Introduction}
		This is the Draft Final Report for the Context Project: Programming Life.\\
		During this project we have built Gigabase, an app to create the virtual cell. The creation of this application was not without its challenges, but as a team we managed to overcome these and together we didn't only work towards a great product, we also grew as individuals, refined our personalities when it comes to teamwork and had a lot of fun.\\
		This document reflects on these challenges, that teamwork and what the project itself means to us.
		
	\section{Key challenges and Solutions}
		The project itself had some challenges that were conceived as difficult. Apart from these challenges, the process itself had some as well, which are listed under 'Reflection on the teamwork'. 
		
		\subsection{ODE}
			Let's first define component as any module or metabolite in the cell such as a transporter or substrate. The biological-cell model consists of components that interact with eachother, but the differential equations are not defined by interaction, but component. Our task was to make these components modular, meaning you need to be able to change them, add more of them and so forth and so on. A differential equation that resides

	\section{Reflection on the teamwork}
		This section covers the reflection as a group on the teamwork during the development of the software. The reflection is divided in different subsections.
		\subsection{Preparation}
			At the very start of the project, the programming language was decided. Because this was done so early, the toolchain and programming environment could be set up almost immediately. The result of these early preperations is that the start of the project was pretty much smooth sailing. \\
			In addition, coding guidelines and styles were discussed, so the group could code consistently in one style from the start.
		
		\subsection{Meetings and contact}
			Every first day of the workweek, there was a Scrum meeting. During those meetings the tasks (finished, in progress and future) were discussed and a planning was made. At the start of every other day, the tasks planned for that week were briefly discussed. \\
			Once a week, there was a meeting with the teaching assistants who guided the group throughout the development. Through them, the group could ask questions concerning the deliverables and goals.
			Communication at home was done with Skype, where regular coding sessions was held during the day and night.

		\subsection{Task delegation}
			During the project, the role of Scrum Master would rotate among the members. This happened naturally, as no explicit roster was made. \\
			When assigning the tasks, most tasks were actively picked up by the members. Rarely has there been a situation where a task had to be assigned by the master and when that happened, the task went to the member with the lowest amount of workload. The workload was not only comprised of tasks within the project, but also their personal lives and other courses. This was accepted within the group and was taken into account during task delegation.

		\subsection{Interpersonal communication}
			During meetings, the communication was open, as questions could be asked to each other at all times. When major points were about to be discussed, all work was halted and everyone actively joined the discussion. Not only does this method ensure that everyone is updated, it also creates an open environment for each other: whenever someone is stuck and thinks it's something major, he can throw it into the group and can expect the full attention of the members.\\
			When not meeting each other in person, communication was done by Skype. This helped immensely, as it creates the same open environment where everyone can ask each other for advice.

		\subsection{Problems and challenges}
			\subsubsection*{Downtime during exams}
				During the planning, the fact that no real work can be done during the exams was not taken into account. This lead to a two to three weeks of considerable slowdown of the project progress.\\
				Nonetheless, there were still short, weekly meetings with the teaching assistents. Immediately after the exams, a revised planning has been made and the lost time during those exams has been made up for.
			\subsubsection*{Differences in level of expertise}
				The group is comprised of members of different levels of expertise, so the decision was made to use a whole new programming language.\\ 
				By doing this, the people with less aptitude in programming can still keep up with the rest, as everyone else is also learning the ropes of this new language.\\
				Members also had their isolated projects where they can work at their own pace. This way, the more adept programmers can develop the more elaborate features and the rest can focus on their own tasks, so they don't slow each other down.\\ 
				Every week during the meetings, there was a mandatory moment where each member had to explain what they did, what went good/bad and what they were planning to do for that week.\\ 
				By doing this, it's possible to ask each other for advice when they were stuck at a problem and thus help each other.
			\subsubsection*{Punctuality}
				A recurring problem in the group was the occasional early meeting. Some members had the tendicy to be tardy and thus keeping the rest of the group waiting. \\
				This has been acknowledged as a problem. This behaviour is not condoned, but the lost time was always compensated. This is a point of improvement for future projects.
			\subsubsection*{Understanding each other's work}
				Because of the scale of the project, a high volume of code can be written in a short amount of time by different members of the group. This make it easy to lose track of each other's work. \\
				By letting other members of the group write test classes for each other, every member is aware of the work done by other members and it helps understand the code. \\
				The code was also actively commented and documentated to further improve code understanding.
			\subsubsection*{Programmer's block}
				To help overcome the occasional programmer's block, pair programming was introduced to the group. One member is responsible of writing the code, while the other observes and reviews the written code. This way, both members are actively coding and can come up with new ideas when the other member is stuck.

	\section{Individual reflections on the project}
		This section of the report contains the personal reflections of each of the team members. It contains every members perspective on the project, rather than the global experience of the group.
