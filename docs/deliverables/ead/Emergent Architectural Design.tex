	\section{Introduction}
		This document contains the architectural design for the application created during the Context Project `Programming Life: Synthetic Biology'. The application is targeted at synthetic biologists and its main purpose is to easily model, simulate and validate the complex workings of a cell. \\
		The design of this application is explained first in terms of its design goals. Then a subsystem decomposition follows, which serves to uncover the inner workings of the application, along with a description of the mapping of subsystems to processes and computers, a hardware/software mapping. After this, the management of data and shared resources is discussed. 
		
		\subsection{Design goals}
			The application can model cells and the processes within. The main design goal is to make this task as easy and intuitive as possible. Further, as requested by the client, it should:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item give an indication how changes to the cell will influence other parts of the cell
				\item have the ability to easily import and export datasets from and to frequently used data-formats e.g. CSV, HTML, PDF and Excel.
				\item give feedback to the user about mistakes and when possible provide a solution. An example is telling the user components are missing for a correctly working cell.
				\item simulate the cell by integrating the corresponding system of ODEs
				\item compare simulations by plotting data on top of other simulations.
				\item be available offline, once the application is loaded once.
				\item have the functionality to share data with other users.
				\item have an easy way to undo changes.
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Additional goals}
			To broaden their knowledge and expand their experience, the developers agreed to use programming languages and frameworks previously unknown to them.

	\section{Architecture}
	
			\subsection{Overview}
				Because the application is available offline, the server-client relation is decoupled. This means that the main functionality resides on the client. The server is merely used for administrative purposes, storing application and user data and providing the client-side functionality. A back end on the server also allows for data manipulation on the database.
				
			\subsection{Server}
				The primary function of the server is to provide the client-side application. After the application is downloaded the first time, it will reside on the client. Each time a client is online the application is automatically updated. \\
				The secondary function of the server is to provide storage for everything created by the user. Sharing data is made possible by the storing functionality. \\
				The figure below illustrates this concept. The server provides all client side assets \footnote{In this context assets are images, Javascript files and style sheets} and outputs these assets and html files to the client. The clients have a local copy of the database, which is synchronised when the client is able to connect to the server.

				\subsubsection{Rails}
					The server runs on Ruby on Rails \cite{ror} . This is a fairly new but very stable platform that is not only free but also open source. This means it is being actively developed by a large number of people. Problems are easily fixed and this should ease the use of the application that is being designed. The language itself is written from a standpoint where you should just be able to write code and not worry about breaking the interpreter \cite{ruby} . This makes it easy to write comprehensible code that executes complex tasks.
								
				\subsubsection{MVC on the server}
					The pages served are HTML5 for markup with CSS3 for styling and Javascript for interaction. Pages are built by a comprehensive and solid Model-Viewer-Controller system. In such a system, data is kept in models, views are their representations - you can have multiple representations per model - and controllers add interaction to these views, control the models that are displayed and isolate all model changes. In short, such system keeps data separated from the representation, further increasing maintainability. Interaction is illustrated in Figure 3. Rails uses MVC at its core. It makes it easy to create the back end views and client side representations because displaying data, the interaction and the actual data are separated.
					
				\subsubsection{MVC Models and Database Design}
					The database design was devised in a specifc way to ensure that there is no data redundancy. Specifically template/blueprint data is seperated from instance/instantiated data. The figure below is a database diagram.
					\begin{figure}[htb]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{erd.pdf}
							\caption{Database and Ruby Models}
							\label{fig: erd}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}
					In the following paragraphs the words module, cell, report, module instance, module template, module parameter and module value and their instantiated forms refer to the figure abobe.
					Solid lines and arrows are associations.  For example, a module instance belongs to a cell, a module instance also has a module template as parent and a cell is bound to a report, whereas a report belongs to a cell.
					The dashed arrows indicate implict asociations. Since the module instance belongs to a cell and a template, a cell could query all the parents - the module templates - of all its module instances. And because a module value belongs to both a module instance and a module parameter, a module instance can query its module parameters.
					A report (see the figure above) is only dynamically defined. There is no additional cell data present in the report model. This enables a one to one relation between reports and cells. The component definitions are separated from the values. A cell contains components, called modules (module\_instance). These components are instances of blueprints (module\_template). Each component blueprint can provide multiple parameters (module\_parameter). Each instance has a value for each parameter (module\_value).\\
					
				\subsubsection{Active Database}
					Ruby models are mapped to any Relational Database Management System (RDBMS \cite{rdbms}) such as SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL. By not restricting the server database technology, switching systems, servers or extending their capacity should be fairly simple and easy. Database operations are done through Active Database, part of Rails, which transparently maps the query to the technology's language.
					
				\subsubsection{Views and ERB} 
					The views are in ERB\cite{erb} which is an HTML template system. It comes with the Rails framework, so it does not require any extra software. Rails controllers written in Ruby can expose data to these views. Using a templating system such as this allows for quick translation from model to display. 
			\begin{figure}[h!]

				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SequenceDiagramLife.png}
				\caption{Sequence Diagram}
				\label{fig: SequenceDiagram}
				\end{center}
				\end{figure}	
			\clearpage

			\subsection{Client}
				The server compiles the client application from Coffeescript to Javascript. This application is completely seperated from the server side functionality except for saving, loading, sharing and the production of reports. The client application is also built upon MVC.
				
				\subsubsection{Helpers}
					\begin{figure}[htb]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{helpers.png}
							\caption{Client Helpers}
							\label{fig: cmodels}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	
					In the figure above the mixable class is shown, as well as a number of concerns - a set a functions that can be augmented with any class derived from mixable. A concern is also known as Trait or Mixin.\\
					DynamicProperties adds the ability to dynamically create JavaScript properties. It has a function to define getters: a read function for a property, define setters: a write function for a property, define non enumerable values: properties that are excluded from the enumeration when enumerating over a class its properties. The Cell and Module models, show in the next section, use this extensively.\\
					TimeMachine adds undo functionality to a class. It adds an action queue - a queue of functions wrapped in actions - to classes that include this concern. The action class is used to fill this queue. It is used by the Cell and Module models.\\
					EventBindings enable listening and triggering events, used by almost all classes. This concern depends on the EventManager class.\\
					Catchable can enclose functions into try catch blocks and trigger callbacks and events instead of breaking the application.\\
					To use one of these concern, a class needs to have the Mixable class in the inheritance chain.
				
				\subsubsection{Models}
					\begin{figure}[htb]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{models.png}
							\caption{Client Models}
							\label{fig: cmodels}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	
					In the figure above you can see the model classes. Each JavaScript class maps to one ModuleTemplate and associated ModuleParameter entries on the server. When a cell or module JavavaScript class is instantiated, it can save the instance data as ModuleInstance and associated ModuleValue entries on the server.
				\clearpage

				\subsubsection{Views}
					\begin{figure}[h!]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{views.png}
							\caption{Client Views}
							\label{fig: cmodels}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	

				\clearpage
					In the figure above there are two basic types: Raphael or HTML. All views can have children and display a single model. Raphael typed views use SVG to display their contents. The views only have display functionality. They do not add interaction. Each view keeps track of changes to the displayed module. Through controllers, views can interact with the models. This is explained and displayed later on. \\
					To keep the figure above from cluttering, a few associations are left out. The Module view has a ModuleProperties popover and Cell, Main and Module views have Notification views. Graph views are contained in a Graphs view, which is just a Collection.
\clearpage
				\subsubsection{Controllers}
					\begin{figure}[htb]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{controllers.png}
							\caption{Client Controllers}
							\label{fig: cmodels}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	
					Controllers add interaction to views and models. Controllers can have children. Parent controllers can alter a child controllers behaviour. This way there is no need for a large set of controllers, e.g. a MainCell controller and a ReportCell are now combined into one Cell controller. \\
					For collections of elements, views can use unobtrusive JavaScript to enlist those elements for interaction. A view might add data-xxx attributes to elements. Controllers may or may not bind Javascript to elements with these attributes. This keeps the HTML clean and the interaction in the controllers hand. 
\clearpage
				\subsubsection{Integration (example)}
					\begin{figure}[h!]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics[scale=1.4]{cell_struct.png}
							\caption{Displaying a Cell}
							\label{fig: cellstruct}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	
					\clearpage
					In the figure above you can see how models, views and controllers come together to display a cell. By creating a cell controller, the subsequent children are added automatically. References are only traversable down the structure, meaning a controller can access its view, but a view can't directly access its controller. The figure shows how displaying a cell is achieved by different components. Editing a cell adds additional views - ModuleProperties - which are yielded from the Module Controller. \\
					
					\begin{figure}[h!]
						\begin{center}
							\includegraphics{main_struct.png}
							\caption{The MVC structure for the main page}
							\label{fig: main struct}
						\end{center}
					\end{figure}	
					In the figure above you can see how the main page is structured. Displaying a cell is not the only functionality, so a new controller and view supply the glue between the cell and other functionality. The main controller adds interaction to the action buttons on the main page and it holds a main view and that in turn holds a pane view with the undo view. This is an example of how views can have children, but controller don't need to interact with the children of views. For the undo view a separate controller does the interaction.

				\subsubsection{Local storage}
					Javascript determines the local storage engine that is available and uses that to maintain an offline copy of the application and the created cells/modules. This makes it very easy to design new cells or edit saved cells even when the user isn't connected to the internet. This is communicated to the user, but requires no further interaction. Synchronization is completely transparent, but if it fails for whatever reason and the fallbacks that are in place don't kick in, a notification is displayed.
		
		\subsection{Data management}
			When the user has access to the server, it can export simulation results to a report in multiple standardised format, such as \emph{HTML}, \emph{Excel} and \emph{PDF} which can then be shared. Maintaining a standardised format allows for consistency in the reports as requested by the user.		
	
		\subsection{Concurrency}
			Each client runs independently and uses asynchronous communication with the server through \emph{REST}/\emph{CRUD} and \emph{AJAX}. Because of this, concurrency issues are very improbable. The client-side application is web-based, and uses only one process. Shared resources are retrieved atomically from and synchronised atomically with the database. Upon failure, the user is notified and possible solutions are provided. At this point the system does not allow concurrent edits on the same data, but this functionality was not requested by the user. Such functionality could be added in the future.\\

	\section{Software Technology}
		This section contains all the information about the software architecture of the application. The section is divided into several subsections to group together interesting information and improve readability.	
		
		\subsection{Framework and Development}
			This section describes the key technologies used during a release cycle.
			It is divided into three subsections; development, testing and production.
			The first subsection is about the development phase, where features are realised.
			The second section is about the testing phase, in which the features mentioned before are tested.
			The third section describes the production/release phase, in which a tested feature is implemented.
			
			\subsubsection{Development}
				During development we make use of Coffeescript\cite{coffeescript} for writing interaction assets, SASS\cite{sass} for styling and SVG\cite{svg} with the Raphael\cite{raphael} framework for visualising part of the application.
				Coffeescript and SASS are preprocessors for respectively Javascript and CSS3. Using these preprocessors gives us the advantage of cleaner syntax.
				By making use of SVG to render the cell every graphical object is also a DOM object, this enables us to attach Javascript event handlers and modify the objects itself.
				
			\subsubsection{Testing}
				We test the application in a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD \cite{bdd}) and Test Driven Development (TDD \cite{tdd} ) way. 
				The Javascript assets are tested using the Jasmine framework \cite{jasmine}. 
				To run all tests in the browser we are making use of the Teabag framework \cite{teabag}. 
				To keep track of code coverage we are making use of the Istanbul framework \cite{istanbul}.
				The Ruby assets (database, MVC architecture - models, controllers, views - and Rails) are tested using the Rspec framework \cite{rspec}.  
				All tests run automatically using Continuous Integration, a practice in which tests are ran every time work has been done within critical sections of the code. 
				Tests and coverage reports are used to ensure maintainability, consistency and quality of the code.
				
			\subsubsection{Release}
				During the Production release the Coffeescript assets are compiled to Javascript\cite{javascript} and the SASS assets are compiled to CSS, after which they are minified and bundled using uglifier\cite{uglifier}. Minified assets take up less space and increase page performance which results in a better user experience and less demand on the web server. 
				SVG is still used for creating visualisations of the cell models.

		\subsection{Ordinary Differential Equation Solver}
			All computations run client-side and are performed by our ODE Solver, which is built upon the numericjs\cite{numericjs} library. This is a library which makes it possible to perform sophisticated numerical computations in pure JavaScript and thus is able to run in the browser. The ODEs are solved using the Dormand-Prince RK method\cite{dormandprince}, also known as the ode45-function in MATLAB (previously used by our client).
			
		\subsection{API}
			The API can be found online here: \url{http://coffeedoc.info/github/Derkje-J/programming-life/} \\
			In the future there will be a Rubydoc online for server-side assets.
		\newpage
			
	\section{Summary}
		The application is a lightweight, cross-platform graphical design tool with a centralised storage database. The architecture ensures its functionality on different kinds of machines as well as the ease of simulating complex cell models. It not only offers stability, ease and intuitive design, it offers it on every modern machine. During development of this application the design goals are continuously used as a mandate for the functionality and dictates the production flow.
