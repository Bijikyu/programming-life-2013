	\section*{Preface}
		This document is a draft for the product vision and planning for the Context Project `Programming Life: Synthetic Biology'. Itâ€™s a proposition for the project structure, workflow and product target result that we will engage in and with during the period of the course. It contains a schedule with set dates, milestones and goals to be achieved and is a guideline for the work that should be done. The contents of this document are subject to changes and should be regarded as such.

	\section{Introduction}
		Synthetic biologists try to create cells that serve a specific purpose, for instance the creation of a product from a source metabolite while maintaining a predetermined rate of cell growth. Before they accomplish this, they would like to simulate the internal workings of cells by simulating their mutual influence on one another using combinations of several differential equations which influence each other. 
By varying the properties, i.e. the factors and values used by these equations, the biologists can simulate the interplay of elements within the cell based on that set of properties. 
However, the complexity of the simulation can be daunting as well as time consuming if done on paper or programmed by hand per set of factors.\\

GigaBase is an intuitive application that should overcome these problems by providing a GUI and allowing the simulation of an extensive number of modules. It allows the user to specify properties of the cell and the elements within, such as the flow rate of a transporter or the initial amount of substrate outside of the cell. This way, a cell can be modelled by solving a system of ODEs representing the specified properties and interactions of each of its modules. By using this application, the user can efficiently find the optimal properties with less work to get the desired outcome, such as maximizing the product of a cell. The user also does ot have to worry about performing calculations which are prone to error and take a long time to perform.
\\

This product will be developed using the Scrum methodologies and the development wil be iterated in weekly sprints.

	\section{Product}
		This section holds the main product vision, the high level product backlog and a general roadmap for the contents of the product during the project.
		\subsection{Product Vision}

			\textbf{FOR} Synthetic Biologists \textbf{WHO LIKE TO} create cells that work in certain ways, GigaBase \textbf{IS AN} application \textbf{THAT} allows the user to simulate a cell's interactions with itself and its environment by selecting modules that make up the cell, varying their properties and the environment, simulating the interplay of elements in the cell and visualising the outcome of the interactions in a graph. \textbf{UNLIKE} modelling the cell by generating and solving an ODE \textbf{OUR SERVICE} fast-tracks designing a cell by providing a GUI, enforces constraints for the entered values of the ODEs to minimize errors, saves time by reusing previous designs and solves the ODE, taking out a possibility for human error.

			\subsubsection*{Sprint 0}
				\textbf{Q3/W4 Draft planning:}\\ The product and domain are researched, the product vision and high-level product backlog are devised with initial listing of user stories composed. The user stories can be found under the product backlog section.\\
				\textbf{Q3/W5 Initial planning:}\\ The user story list is fine-tuned and tasks are devised for the first sprints.\\
				The user stories can be found under the product backlog section. After this sprint all code for internal workings should be present.\\		
				\textbf{Q3/W6}\\
				Toolchain needed to develop the code is set up. Basic module and cell classes are made and properly tested.

				A cell can be created by selecting modules from a list. Start working on integration tests.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 2 (Q3/W10) Demo product}
				A basic visualisation of the internal workings is present. This consists of at least one graph per module that indicates the concentration over time. A set of modules with predefined property values is available for cell modelling. Equations are solved using an ODE solver.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 3 (Q4/W1)}
				Initial rigorous acceptance tests, as the next sprint requires a product demo. Substrates can now be added to the cell. Tests are run automatically using Continuous Integration. Release first version with basic functionality.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 4 (Q4/W2)}
				All events should now be handled by an Event Manager. There should be a reasonable amount of tests covering a reasonable amount of code, i.e. around 80\%. Release the demo version for the product demo.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 5 (Q4/W3)}
				The GUI now provides a graphical way to add modules to the cell it also provides a way to control the simulation of the cell. The cell models created can now be saved and loaded. An API is also provided. Preparation for SIG evaluation by cleaning up redundant code and adding documentation where needed.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 6 (Q4/W4)}
				HTML/PDF/EXCEL reports can now be generated from created cell models, containing parameter values and graphs from simulations. A user can now change module constants. Connections between modules are visualised. 
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 7 (Q4/W5)}
				Bug-fixes, acceptance tests and final review of code. Implement improvements based on SIG feedback. A user can use the undo function in the GUI. Feedback on module constraints and errors is visible.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 8 (Q4/W6)}
				Code cleanup, maintenance, bug fixing and other possible improvent to the system.
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 9 (Q4/W7)}
				Feedback on optimisation is now visible in the application. 
			\subsubsection*{Sprint 10 (Q4/W8) Final product}
				All remaining bugs are fixed. All tests should pass with a good coverage, i.e. around 80\%. Prepare for product presentation. Release presentation demo version.

	\subsection{Product mockup}
		In the image below is the mockup we drew of the product graphical user interface, showing a cell and its modules. The modules which interact with each other are connected and clicking on the modules reveals more information.

	\section{Product backlog}
		The product backlog is a list of possible features that gives a high-level description of the functionality that needs to be implemented before the application actually contains the feature. The priority of each story is defined by its position in the backlog. The higher on the backlog, the more important the item is and the more descriptive its required functionality is. Items that have been defined clearly enough also get a rough estimate of the amount of man-hours required to fully implement the feature described in that item.

	\section{Definition of done}
		Defining when the following are done is important to keep the project flow consistent and make sure the product is deliverable. \\
		\\
		\textbf{Task:} If all the items from the task description are completed and this can be verified with one or more \emph{user} and/or an \emph{integration} tests. This is important because features have to be complete, otherwise there will be unfinished code in the system causing instability.\\
		\newline
		\textbf{User Story:} If the story is fulfilled and this can be tested with one or more \emph{acceptance tests}. This is important because the user stories are the basis for defining the functions the system must provide.\\
		\newline
		\textbf{Sprint:} Sunday 23:59. This is important because it limits the amount of work done during a sprint, forcing a controlled workflow.\\
		\newline
		(version of a) \textbf{Product/Release:} If the product can be shipped to the \emph{stakeholder}. This is important because this is what the stakeholder gets to see. It can be shipped when all features which are considered a MUST and SHOULD are implemented, see the high-level product backlog and roadmap. \\
		\newline
		\textbf{Project:} Never or when the \emph{stakeholder} decides (\emph{June 14$^{th}$}).

	\section{Glossary}
